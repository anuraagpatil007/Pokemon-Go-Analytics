# Pokemon-Go-Analytics
Pokémon Go! became a very famous augmented reality (AR) game in 2016 summer.
1. In this project, we want to understand the success of the mobile app game. The goal of the project is to predict values of "Total IOS Ratings" and "Total Android Ratings" for 2016/11/01 11:50 PM.
2. For that we did web scraping using BeautifulSoup4, Constructed a Pandas data frame, explored/ and visualized the numeric data using matplotlib or seaborne by generating scatter matrix and calculating the Pearson’s correlation coefficients for the identified pairs.
3. Analyzed the app’s screenshot images using deep learning with TensorFlow
4. Finally to used sklearn to build machine learning models to predict the app’s review counts using cross validation algorithms like Linear Regression, Ridge Regression and Lasso.

TechStack:
( Python - 3.6
